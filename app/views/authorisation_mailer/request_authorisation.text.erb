Acces request
======================================

<%= @authorisation.requester.full_identity %> has requested access for a part of your Gmail inbox, to see everything that has to do with "<%= @authorisation.scope %>".

<% if !@authorisation.description.empty? %>	
	Here's why they request access:
	<%= @authorisation.description %>
<% end %>

To grant or deny that request, please follow this link (you'll be asked to login with Gmail if you're not already using Passiton):
<%= authorisation_grant_url %>

Thanks,
Your Passiton team
