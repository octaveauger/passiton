Delegation request
======================================

<%= @delegation.manager.full_identity %> would like to grant access to your emails on your behalf

<% unless @delegation.description %>
	Here's a note from <%= @delegation.manager.first_name %>:
	<%= @delegation.description %>
<% end %>

<% if @delegation.employee.guest %>
	<%= @delegation.manager.first_name %> is using Passiton (<%= root_url %>), which makes it easy to share context and emails between teammates without having to forward each email one by one, or giving full access to your inbox to someone else.
<% end %>

You can confirm this delegation request by clicking this: <%= delegation_confirm_url(@delegation.token) %>

You can revoke this permission at any time. <%= @delegation.manager.first_name %> will not gain access to your full inbox: they will only be able to see the emails others would like you to share, and approve or deny their requests on your behalf.

If you have any questions about this request, please contact <%= @delegation.manager.first_name %>.

<%= render partial: 'boilerplate/email_footer' %>
