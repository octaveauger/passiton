Delegation revoked
======================================

<%= @delegation.employee.full_identity %> has revoked the control you had of their Passiton account. You will no longer receive nor review any request to access some of their emails and share context.

You can request the authorisation again any time you wish. It will need to be approved by <%= @delegation.employee.full_identity %> again.
